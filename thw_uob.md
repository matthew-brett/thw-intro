# Hacker Culture

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture

> What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They
> wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They
> also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do
> something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show
> "Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done."

Richard Stallman, interview as shown in [Hackers — Wizards of the Electronic
Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Wizards_of_the_Electronic_Age)

# Begley and Ellis 2012

Scientists at Amgen (a drug company) tried to reproduce findings from 53
"landmark" studies.

> ... when findings could not be reproduced, an attempt was made to contact
> the original authors, discuss the discrepant findings, exchange reagents and
> repeat experiments under the authors’ direction, occasionally even in the
> laboratory of the original investigator.

Of 53 studies, only 6 replicated (11%).

# Cargo cult science

> In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw
> airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to
> happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires
> along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in,
> with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo
> sticking out like antennas —-- he's the controller -- and they wait for the
> airplanes to land.  They're doing everything right. The form is perfect
> [...]. But it doesn't work.

[Richard Feynman](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) (1974) Cargo Cult Science.

# The SCHAT principles

* Sceptical,
* Careful,
* Honest And
* Transparent.

# Sceptical

> Science alone of all the subjects contains within itself the lesson of the
> danger of belief in the infallibility of the greatest teachers in the
> preceding generation... Learn from science that you must doubt the experts
> ...
> Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts

Richard Feynman, What is Science? (1969)

# Careful

> The scientific method's central motivation is the ubiquity of error - the
> awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywhere
> and that the scientist's effort is primarily expended in recognizing and
> rooting out error."

Donoho, David L, et al. 2009. Reproducible research in computational
harmonic analysis. *Computing in Science & Engineering* 11, 8--18.

# Careful

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the
> easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After
> you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just
> have to be honest in a conventional way after that.

Richard Feynman, Cargo Cult Science (1974)

# Honest

> It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
> corresponds to a kind of utter honesty --- a kind of leaning over backwards.

Richard Feynman, Cargo Cult Science (1974)

# Transparent

> For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything
> that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about
> it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you
> thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they
> worked --- to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated
> ...  In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help
> others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information
> that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.

Richard Feynman, Cargo Cult Science (1974)

# The difference between true and false

> In studies for which findings could be reproduced, authors had paid close
> attention to controls, reagents, investigator bias and describing the
> complete data set. For results that could not be reproduced, however, data
> were not routinely analysed by investigators blinded to the experimental
> versus control groups. Investigators frequently presented the results of one
> experiment, such as a single Western-blot analysis. They sometimes said they
> presented specific experiments that supported their underlying hypothesis,
> but that were not reflective of the entire data set.

# Ubiquity of error

> In my own experience, error is ubiquitous in scientific computing, and one
> needs to work very diligently and energetically to eliminate it. One needs a
> very clear idea of what has been done in order to know where to look for
> likely sources of error. I often cannot really be sure what a student or
> colleague has done from his/her own presentation, and in fact often his/her
> description does not agree with my own understanding of what has been done,
> once I look carefully at the scripts. Actually, I find that researchers
> quite generally forget what they have done and misrepresent their
> computations. ...

# Ubiquity of error

> Computing results are now being presented in a very loose, “breezy” way—in
> journal articles, in conferences, and in books. All too often one simply
> takes computations at face value. This is spectacularly against the evidence
> of my own experience. I would much rather that at talks and in referee
> reports, the possibility of such error were seriously examined.

# The hacker culture comes to the rescue

We:

* value competence, transparency and equality;
* are constantly learning;
* teach each other;
* give our stuff away;
* always prefer open;
* contribute to the tools that we use.
